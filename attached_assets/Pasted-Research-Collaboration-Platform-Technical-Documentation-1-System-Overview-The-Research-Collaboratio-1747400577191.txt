Description
2.2 Database Tables and Relationships
For each entity defined above, we'll create corresponding database tables with appropriate columns. Key relationships include:
One-to-One: Users to Profiles
One-to-Many: Profiles to Education, Experience, Publications, etc.
Many-to-Many: Implemented via junction tables (e.g., Applications connecting Users and Opportunities)
2.3 Indexing Strategy
Primary keys: All tables will have auto-incrementing primary keys
Foreign keys: Indexed to optimize join operations
Search-related columns: Keywords, Names, Domains will be indexed
Date fields: For filtering by recency/deadlines
2.4 Data Normalization
The database design follows the Third Normal Form (3NF) to minimize redundancy while maintaining data integrity and query efficiency.
