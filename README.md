- **Opportunity Discovery**: Browse and search for research opportunities across various domains
- **Messaging System**: Direct communication between users
- **Application Management**: Streamlined process for applying to opportunities
- **Admin Dashboard**: Comprehensive admin controls for platform management

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- PostgreSQL database
- Git

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/research-collaboration-platform.git
   cd research-collaboration-platform
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file with the following variables:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/database_name
   SESSION_SECRET=your_secure_secret_key
   ```

5. **Initialize the database**
   ```bash
   python initialize_database.py
   ```

6. **Create demo users (optional)**
   ```bash
   python create_demo_users.py
   ```

7. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```
   The application will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000/

## Production Deployment

### Option 1: Deploy using Gunicorn

1. **Install Gunicorn**
   ```bash
   pip install gunicorn
   ```

2. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 --workers 4 main:app
   ```

### Option 2: Deploy to a cloud platform

The application can be deployed to various cloud platforms:

- **Heroku**: Use the provided Procfile
- **AWS**: Deploy using Elastic Beanstalk or EC2
- **Google Cloud**: Use App Engine or Cloud Run

### Important Production Considerations

- Use environment variables for all sensitive information
- Set DEBUG=False in production
- Use HTTPS with a valid SSL certificate
- Set up database backups
- Implement proper logging

## Demo Accounts

The following demo accounts are available for testing the platform functionality:

| User Type | Email | Password | Description |
|----------|-------|----------|-------------|
| Student | student@example.com | password123 | Demo student account with complete profile |
| PI | pi@example.com | password123 | Demo PI account with lab information |
| Industry | industry@example.com | password123 | Demo industry partner account |
| Vendor | vendor@example.com | password123 | Demo vendor account |
| Admin | admin@example.com | admin123 | Administrator account with full access |

## Database Structure

The platform uses a relational database model with the following key tables:

- `users`: User authentication information
- `profiles`: Basic profile information for all users
- `student_profiles`, `pi_profiles`, `industry_profiles`, `vendor_profiles`: Type-specific profile data
- `opportunities`: Research positions and collaborations
- `applications`: User applications to opportunities
- `messages`: Direct messages between users
- `notifications`: System notifications
